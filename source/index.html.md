# Introduction

## API Key Setup

* Some endpoints will require an API Key. Please refer to [this page](https://www.pexpayzh.top/en/support/faq/360002502072) regarding API key creation.
* Once API key is created, it is recommended to set IP restrictions on the key for security reasons.
* **Never share your API key/secret key to ANYONE.**

<aside class="warning">
If the API keys were accidentally shared, please delete them immediately and create a new key.

# General Info
## General API Information

* The base endpoint is: **https://api.pexpay.com**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in **milliseconds**.

### HTTP Return Codes
* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests;
  the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on
  Pexpay's side.
  It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is
  **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.

### Error Codes and Messages

* If there is an error, the API will return an error with a message of the reason.

> The error payload is as follows:
 
```javascript
{
  "code": ${error code},
  "msg": "error message."
}
```

* Specific error codes and messages defined in [Error Codes](#error-codes).

### General Information on Endpoints

* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.

---
## LIMITS

### General Info on Limits
* The following `intervalLetter` values for headers:
    * SECOND => S
    * MINUTE => M
    * HOUR => H
    * DAY => D
* `intervalNum` describes the amount of the interval. For example, `intervalNum` 5 with `intervalLetter` M means "Every 5 minutes".
* A 429 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.

### IP Limits
* Every request will contain `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
* A `Retry-After` header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the **number of seconds** required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
* **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**


### /sapi/ Limit Introduction

The `/sapi/*` endpoints adopt either of two access limiting rules, IP limits or UID (account) limits.

  * Endpoints are marked according to IP or UID limit and their corresponding weight value.
  * Each endpoint with IP limits has an independent 12000 per minute limit.
  * Each endpoint with UID limits has an independent 180000 per minute limit.
  * Responses from endpoints with IP limits contain the header `X-SAPI-USED-IP-WEIGHT-1M`, defining the weight used by the current IP.
  * Responses from endpoints with UID limits contain the header `X-SAPI-USED-UID-WEIGHT-1M`, defining the weight used by the current UID.

---
## SIGNED (TRADE, USER_DATA, AND MARGIN) Endpoint security
* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, `signature`, to be
  sent in the  `query string` or `request body`.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256 signature` is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation.
  Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
* `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the
  `request body`.

### Timing security
* A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which
  should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
* An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of
  milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow`
  is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**.

> The logic is as follows:

```javascript
  if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow)
  {
    // process request
  } 
  else 
  {
    // reject request
  }
```

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable,
which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the
servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be
processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the
server.

<aside class="notice">
It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less! The max cannot go beyond 60,000!
